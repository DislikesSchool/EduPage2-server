## EduPage2 - The fastest mobile client for EduPage
If you use EduPage, you might know how slow it gets sometimes. That is why [EduPage2](https://github.com/DIslikesSchool/EduPage2) was developed. 
It focuses on speed improvements and optimizations, as well as a simpler and more modern UI.
### Self hosting made easy
EduPage2 now also supports the option to host the backend yourself, and with [Deta](https://deta.space) this is as easy as it can be.
It's literally a one-click install!
