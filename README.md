# EduPage2 - server
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/DislikesSchool/EduPage2-server/graph/badge.svg?token=BXliJAEhQz)](https://codecov.io/gh/DislikesSchool/EduPage2-server)
## What is this?
This repository will house the code for the backend server of EduPage2. This server's code is currently undergoing a complete rewrite from js to golang.

The base of this version will be taken from [eduhelper-edupage-client](https://github.com/WattMann/eduhelper-edupage-client) by [WattMann](https://github.com/WattMann) who has also offered to help in the development.
## Why is this public if it's not ready?
This repository is public mostly to show the progress being made in the rewrite. We would also welcome help from anyone.
## Why do a rewrite?
The curent servre's code is written in js. It is all very unorganized, hard to read, and would be hard to continue maintaining. Therefore we have decided to rewrite the code in go, for better performance and to be generally easier to maintain.
## Why release publicly?
One of the main features of EduPage2 is that it is mostly open source. The backend server is the last remaining part that is not publicly accessible. This will change it.
## Will I be able to selfhost?
Yes! There will still be a publicly accessible instance of this server running for whoever wants to use EduPage2 without having to setup hosting, but for anyone interested in doing so, there will also be the option to run your own instance.
